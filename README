  ABOUT

This is a simple Python script that shows a wiggly line in random colors. This line can be configured to be made out of any text, that you can come up with.

  COMPATABILITY

This program will only work on Windows, but feel free to add Linux compatability through a PR! This code is quite messy though, so just ignore most of it.
